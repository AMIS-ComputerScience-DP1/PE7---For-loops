# PE7---For-loops

This lab introduces the use of `for` loops in Python. You will practice iterating through specific ranges and traversing lists to perform calculations.

## Learning Objectives
* Use `range()` to execute code a specific number of times.
* Iterate through a list to access and process elements.
* Accumulate values (summing/counting) within a loop.

## Instructions
1. Open `PE7exercises.py`.
2. Complete the tasks inside the functions. 
3. **Do not change the function names.**
4. Run the file to see the results of the "Autocheck" at the bottom.
